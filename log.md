# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: April 23rd 2018
#####
**Todays progress:** Started working through the CodeCamp workshops, set up CodePen Enviroment 
###
**Thoughts:** Currently insanely tired for reasons, but I have made a pretty solid start on the the code camp workshops. I got slightly sidetracked into setting up the CodePen interface, but I think I probably can do the first project (Tribute Website) without a lot more work throughs. Definately need to start taking a stab at JQuery.

### Day 2: April 24th 2018
#####
**Today's progress:** Carried on working through the CodeCamp workshops, finished basic HTML and bootstrap 
###
**Thoughts:** Still mostly going over stuff I did at CFG, but it was interesting to see how different teaching methods approched bootstrap. And I was finally able to use Icons! Hyped to get to jQuery. Have decided to do my tribute website to Ethel Brilliana Tweedie. Which is going to be top bants. 


### Day 3: April 25th 2018 
#####
**Today's progress:** Worked through all of CodeCamp's jQuery stuff. Did about half of W3 school, up to jQuery animate. 
###
**Thoughts:** Suprised at how straight forward I found jQuery. I think I probably just had a bit of a mental block but weirdly learning it before digging into JavaScript meant that I could focus on what it *did* rather than exactly how it worked. Hopefully the JavaScript bits will make the how exactly clearer. Quickly set up stuff for my website projects. Have decided to do them in Atom bc it should help with linking stuff together. For the first two websites probably not going to use significant amounts of JavaScript, but might have an expiriment. Planning to commit approx 50:50 to working through tutorials vs building the code. Also going to buy myself the two Jon Duckett books as a present, in theory for finishing but who knows!

### Day 4: April 26th 2018
#####
**Today's progress:** Did a little bith more JavaScript, can now write the maths functions. Made a start on the tribute website. 
###
**Thoughts:** JavaScript fairly straight forward. Need to be v concious of what variable are what. May also need reminders for the maths, but that seems to mostly be a principles problem. Started building my Ethel website in Atom. Feel slightly conflicted re: copying a load of code for the timeline. I think I might make the website proper, with bootstrap and then use that to *inspire* my handmade CodePen version to practise my CSS. 


### Day 5: 28/04/2018
#####
**Today's progress:** worked on JavaScript and timeline
###
**Thoughts:** Got throught the basics of JavaScript quite quickly. Very similar to the Python principes, but given its the start probably universal principles tbh. Slightly stop and start but I kept going.


### Day 6: 29/04/2018
#####
**Today's progress:** More JavaScript, mostly operators and boolean variables. Tweaked my timeline, but mostly for the commit if we are honest.
###
**Thoughts:** Wasn't feeling super focus on anything today, but managed to crack through a fair bit of Javascript. Got very tied up on global and local variables. But I think I might have misplaced a semi-colon. Kind of comforted that it has taken me until day 6 to get so stuck I had to look up the code. So taking that as a sign that I am improving! 


### Day 8: 30/04/2018
#####
**Today's progress:** Tiny bit of JavaScript, but mostly focused on the website. Added in photographs and a bloackquote. 
###
**Thoughts:** Still can't quite get over the imposter syndrome that I am just shoving other people's answers into my code. But I was pleased with my blockquote and my picture caption so hopefully i will get there! 


### Day 9: 01/05/18
#####
**Today's progress:** Worked on Ethel website. Managed to make javascript and about 80% of the photocarosel work.  
###
**Thoughts:** Really felt like I made some progress today. Managed to solve a javascript problem on my own which felt super cool. I managed to put a photocarosel into the Ethel website. Bit of a struggle to get it to fix it, I think I might need to load some javascript. 

### Day 10: 02/05/18
#####
**Today's progress:** Worked on CV website, went over some javascript basics on codeacademy
###
**Thoughts:** Very choppy day. I am slightly sleepy so I don't that help. Made my way through the very basic bits of codeacademy, so that I can go back to caodecamp and work out how to lookup arrays.

### Day 11: 03/05/18
#####
**Today's progress:** Fixed photograph carousel 
###
**Thoughts:** Just a quick one today because lots of phone calls, but managed to intigrate javascript into bootstrap which was very exciting as I managed to make my carousel work. Think I would like to build some interesting gym apps, saw one that let you look up how much you lift in terms of animals which I reckon might be doable as my end-of-hundred days project.


### Day 12: 04/05/18
#####
**Today's progress:** Worked on resume on the train. 
###
**Thoughts:** The lack of internet was suprisingly difficult. Next time I probably need to plan for next time. But decided to remove the skills bar graph thing as it mostly seemed silly. Hopefully going to use this as the basics for my codepen project.



### Day 13: 07/05/18
#####
**Today's progress:** Finished object oriented javascript bit of CodeCamp and reversed a string!
###
**Thoughts:** I know I know, but actually the bank holiday did me a lot of good (and sunburn). I was able to finish off the Object Oriented bit of javascript as well as reverse a string and I was super proud because while I did some googling around I managed without the hints. Also my twitter has the wrong day, lols. 

### Day 14 - 17: 08/05/18 to 11/05/18
######
**Today's (lol) progress:** Completed a little more Javascript, did the html, css, and even a little javascript on my two websites. 
###
**Thoughts:** Mainly that I have been kind of crap at updating the log, so my first commitment is going to be to try and improve that. Have also given up on Gitting everyday as it were, while useful if I am not colabing with someone its mostly just a vanity thing. Have made leaps and bounds on my portfolio website. Obvs it is slightly basic but I have inculded some stuff I am really proud of in there that definately didn't work in the Glasgow project which is great. I just need to get my head around javascript a little bit more.....

### Day 18 18/05/18
######
**Today's progress:** Completed the codedojo basic projects, inculding a magic eight ball and a simple music based application. Half way through to do list
###
**Thoughts:** Clearly forgot to update again (oops!) but have been gentally working my way through some more javascript. Probably also need to work out how to use jQuery. Quite pleased with how I am doing with javascript but still haven't managed to do algorythmic stuff on code camp.
