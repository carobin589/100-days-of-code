# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: April 23rd 2018
#####
**Todays progress:** Started working through the CodeCamp workshops, set up CodePen Enviroment 
###
**Thoughts:** Currently insanely tired for reasons, but I have made a pretty solid start on the the code camp workshops. I got slightly sidetracked into setting up the CodePen interface, but I think I probably can do the first project (Tribute Website) without a lot more work throughs. Definately need to start taking a stab at JQuery.

### Day 2: April 24th 2018
#####
**Today's progress:** Carried on working through the CodeCamp workshops, finished basic HTML and bootstrap 
###
**Thoughts:** Still mostly going over stuff I did at CFG, but it was interesting to see how different teaching methods approched bootstrap. And I was finally able to use Icons! Hyped to get to jQuery. Have decided to do my tribute website to Ethel Brilliana Tweedie. Which is going to be top bants. 


### Day 3: April 25th 2018 
#####
**Today's progress:** Worked through all of CodeCamp's jQuery stuff. Did about half of W3 school, up to jQuery animate. 
###
**Thoughts:** Suprised at how straight forward I found jQuery. I think I probably just had a bit of a mental block but weirdly learning it before digging into JavaScript meant that I could focus on what it *did* rather than exactly how it worked. Hopefully the JavaScript bits will make the how exactly clearer. Quickly set up stuff for my website projects. Have decided to do them in Atom bc it should help with linking stuff together. For the first two websites probably not going to use significant amounts of JavaScript, but might have an expiriment. Planning to commit approx 50:50 to working through tutorials vs building the code. Also going to buy myself the two Jon Duckett books as a present, in theory for finishing but who knows!
