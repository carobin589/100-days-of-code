# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: April 23rd 2018
#####
**Todays progress:** Started working through the CodeCamp workshops, set up CodePen Enviroment 
###
**Thoughts:** Currently insanely tired for reasons, but I have made a pretty solid start on the the code camp workshops. I got slightly sidetracked into setting up the CodePen interface, but I think I probably can do the first project (Tribute Website) without a lot more work throughs. Definately need to start taking a stab at JQuery.

### Day 2: April 24th 2018
#####
**Today's progress:** Carried on working through the CodeCamp workshops, finished basic HTML and bootstrap 
###
**Thoughts:** Still mostly going over stuff I did at CFG, but it was interesting to see how different teaching methods approched bootstrap. And I was finally able to use Icons! Hyped to get to jQuery. Have decided to do my tribute website to Ethel Brilliana Tweedie. Which is going to be top bants. 


### Day 3: April 25th 2018 
#####
**Today's progress:** Worked through all of CodeCamp's jQuery stuff. Did about half of W3 school, up to jQuery animate. 
###
**Thoughts:** Suprised at how straight forward I found jQuery. I think I probably just had a bit of a mental block but weirdly learning it before digging into JavaScript meant that I could focus on what it *did* rather than exactly how it worked. Hopefully the JavaScript bits will make the how exactly clearer. Quickly set up stuff for my website projects. Have decided to do them in Atom bc it should help with linking stuff together. For the first two websites probably not going to use significant amounts of JavaScript, but might have an expiriment. Planning to commit approx 50:50 to working through tutorials vs building the code. Also going to buy myself the two Jon Duckett books as a present, in theory for finishing but who knows!

### Day 4: April 26th 2018
#####
**Today's progress:** Did a little bith more JavaScript, can now write the maths functions. Made a start on the tribute website. 
###
**Thoughts:** JavaScript fairly straight forward. Need to be v concious of what variable are what. May also need reminders for the maths, but that seems to mostly be a principles problem. Started building my Ethel website in Atom. Feel slightly conflicted re: copying a load of code for the timeline. I think I might make the website proper, with bootstrap and then use that to *inspire* my handmade CodePen version to practise my CSS. 


### Day 5: 28/04/2018
#####
**Today's progress:** worked on JavaScript and timeline
###
**Thoughts:** Got throught the basics of JavaScript quite quickly. Very similar to the Python principes, but given its the start probably universal principles tbh. Slightly stop and start but I kept going.


### Day 6: 29/04/2018
#####
**Today's progress:** More JavaScript, mostly operators and boolean variables. Tweaked my timeline, but mostly for the commit if we are honest.
###
**Thoughts:** Wasn't feeling super focus on anything today, but managed to crack through a fair bit of Javascript. Got very tied up on global and local variables. But I think I might have misplaced a semi-colon. Kind of comforted that it has taken me until day 6 to get so stuck I had to look up the code. So taking that as a sign that I am improving! 


### Day 8: 30/04/2018
#####
**Today's progress:** Tiny bit of JavaScript, but mostly focused on the website. Added in photographs and a bloackquote. 
###
**Thoughts:** Still can't quite get over the imposter syndrome that I am just shoving other people's answers into my code. But I was pleased with my blockquote and my picture caption so hopefully i will get there!
