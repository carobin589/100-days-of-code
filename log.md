# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: April 23rd 2018
#####
**Todays progress:** Started working through the CodeCamp workshops, set up CodePen Enviroment
**Thoughts:** Currently insanely tired for reasons, but I have made a pretty solid start on the the code camp workshops. I got slightly sidetracked into setting up the CodePen interface, but I think I probably can do the first project (Tribute Website) without a lot more work throughs. Definately need to start taking a stab at JQuery.
