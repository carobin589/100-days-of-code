# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: April 23rd 2018
#####
**Todays progress:** Started working through the CodeCamp workshops, set up CodePen Enviroment 
###
**Thoughts:** Currently insanely tired for reasons, but I have made a pretty solid start on the the code camp workshops. I got slightly sidetracked into setting up the CodePen interface, but I think I probably can do the first project (Tribute Website) without a lot more work throughs. Definately need to start taking a stab at JQuery.

### Day 2: April 24th 2018
#####
**Today's progress:** Carried on working through the CodeCamp workshops, finished basic HTML and bootstrap 
###
**Thoughts:** Still mostly going over stuff I did at CFG, but it was interesting to see how different teaching methods approched bootstrap. And I was finally able to use Icons! Hyped to get to jQuery. Have decided to do my tribute website to Ethel Brilliana Tweedie. Which is going to be top bants.
